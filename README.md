# Syestematic-Momentum-Investing
This Project is a model to predict returns using back testing, momentum and volatility of Time series data on Indian Markets
This project is a customized implementation of the systematic momentum model from the book “Trading Evolved” by ANDREAS F. CLENOW, Chapter 12 (http://www.followingthetrend.com/trading-evolved/) 
In this project, I have implemented Back testing strategies from scratch and Machine Learning concepts like exponential 
regression for momentum calculation and standard deviation for volatility calculation.
